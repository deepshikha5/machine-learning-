# Machine Learning

A short introduction to Machine Learning (ML) and how to get started with this repository.

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed for each task. Common approaches include:
- Supervised learning: learn from labeled examples (classification, regression).
- Unsupervised learning: find structure in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- Reinforcement learning: learn by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards.

## Common tasks
- Classification — assign discrete labels to inputs (e.g., spam detection).
- Regression — predict continuous values (e.g., price forecasting).
- Clustering — group similar items (e.g., customer segmentation).
- Dimensionality reduction — simplify data while retaining structure (e.g., PCA).

## Typical workflow
1. Data collection and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
3. Model selection and training
4. Evaluation and validation (cross-validation, metrics)
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Deployment and monitoring

## Tools & libraries
- Python, NumPy, pandas
- scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments and visualization

## Getting started with this repo
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt if provided).
4. Explore notebooks or scripts to see example workflows and models.
5. Run experiments and adapt code for your datasets.
